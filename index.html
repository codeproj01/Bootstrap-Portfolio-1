      <p>My name is Clifton Nwokeuku, I earned a FullStack MERN programming certificate through a Boot Camp Coding
        certification curriculum at the University of Minnesota for professional studies, in partnership with Trilogy
        educational services. As a FullStack web developer concentrating on the MERN stack techonologies, the
        applications I develop use multiple frameworks. It comprises of several open-source components such as MongoDB,
        React.js, Node.js and Express.js. This was a transition for me from a Systems engineering background to a
        development and programming discipline in software engineering.</p>

      <p>I have a portfolio of the projects and assignments that I completed which is being presented on this platform.
        My portfolio has both individual projects that I built and deployed and some collaborative projects. All linked
        to my github pages.</p>

      <p>This emerging industry continues to grow and the demand to keep up with the ever changing technologies becomes
        a necessity. I will continue to hone my skill sets in new and emerging techologies that drive the industry for
        software engineers, DevOps engineers, web developers and programmers. These communities continue to evolve and
        the evolution has many industries seeking to respond more effectively to their business challenges.</p>
